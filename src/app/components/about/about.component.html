        My artistic family background has influenced me immensely while growing up. I started drawing and painting naturally at a very young age, for as long as I can remember. My passion for drawing and painting had eventually landed me at Zed Institute of Creative Arts to attend a 3 years diploma in Animation Film Designing program. This was after I completed a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Science from University of Calcutta.

      During my tenure in Gaming and Animation industry for over 23 years, I worked with reputed organizations from USA, India and Europe in different capacities. I lived in Las Vegas and had been associated with Konami Gaming Inc., for over a decade as a consultant and delivered game-art and graphics for many slot gaming titles. Besides that, I did art directions for many online games from NetEnt and SpinPlay Games.

      In the first phase of my career, I had extensive experience in traditional animation productions. I worked on some of the prestigious animation projects from Walt Disney, Discovery Kids, Fox Animation Studios, Zoom Cartoons Entertainment, and many more. I also love singing and take a lot of interest in world music.
